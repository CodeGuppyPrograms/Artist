Artist is a drawing program with a twist: it generates the source code of the drawing that the user makes!

With Artist you can visually add colored shapes on the screen and when done, at a click of a button you’ll get the source code. And since this is valid JavaScript source code, you can copy and paste it in a new code window so you can persist and share your drawing as code!

By coding Artist, you’ll learn important concepts such as:

-	How to implement UI elements from scratch
-	How to implement an Undo/ Redo mechanism
-	How to generate code automatically
 
## Source code
